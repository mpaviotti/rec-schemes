Programming Algorithms using Recursion schemes 

The aim of this project is to implement algorithms using folds, unfolds and adjoint folds.

For example, Recursion Schemes From Comonads (RSFCs) [Uustalu, Vene, Pardo, 2001] are used 
to implement Dynamic Programming which can improve the efficiency of recursive algorithms.
Like any recursion scheme, they arise from an adjoint fold.
